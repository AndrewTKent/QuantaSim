# QuantaSim
QuantaSim is a high-performance C++ trading simulator that emulates a stock exchange's order book and execution engine. It supports market, limit, and stop orders, processing them in real-time with minimal latency. Designed for speed and scalability, QuantaSim is ideal for developing and testing high-frequency trading strategies.

## Project Overview
